in this project i created an automatic eda
the project asks the user to upload a csv  file, checks the right encoding and reads it.
then the user can look at all sorts of statistics on the data:
1. all of the columns (the head of the db)
2. statistics on the numeric columns
3. bar plots on the categorial columns
4. correlation matrix
5. pair plots, with the option to split the data by hue
6. knn - where you can select a random row, choose a categorial column and numeric columns to categorize by, and the algorithm will try and 
predict the right category for the column
